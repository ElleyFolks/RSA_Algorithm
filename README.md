# RSA_Algorithm_V1
Created by Drake and Elley Folks in equal collaboration.
First version of RSA Algorithm (asymmetric key) encryption and decryption. Creates public and private key pair, encrypts and also decrypts plaintext message.
Did not implement using classes. Look at RSA_Algorithim_V2 for better implementation!

# RSA_Algorithm_V2
Contributions made by both Drake and Elley to add more functionality to program. 

Can now generate and store a key pair onto a text document on user's device. Program is able to access these keys for later encryption/decryption. Can now encrypt a message with a friend's public key for them to decrypt later with their private key. Can now decrypt messages from a friend that they sent you using your public key. Has two options for encryption- can encrypt and save to a text file or can copy to clip board to paste elsewhere. Program is able to decrypt a message in a text file or a message pasted directly into the terminal.

# To do
--Streamline the RSA class and remove any redundancies<br />
--Improve coding techniques for file reading methods in the RSA class<br />
--Add a basic menu system<br />
--Add a basic GUI based off of the menu system<br />

This project is on-going and we intend to keep improving it as our knowledge grows.<br />
